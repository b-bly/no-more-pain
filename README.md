An app for sharing injury treatments that have worked for you.

Have you ever struggled to get over an injury?  I have had athletic injuries that persisted after seeing multiple health professionals.  I spent many hours Googling to try to find effective injury treatment and prevention.  I found there were many people out there who wanted to help others by sharing their experiences and also those seeking help.  I was inspired to create a place for this sharing to take place.

Everyone's body is different and physical therapy is not one size fits all.  This is a place to share what has worked for you.

Disclaimer: This is not meant to take the place of professional medical treatment.  You should consult your doctor and therapist regarding your injury treatment.
